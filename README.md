- **Ratio plugin is a luck plugin. The more lucky you are, the more you win!**

### Features
- When you break a block (Cobblestone), it gives/puts you something random.

### Support
- Since it's new, it's missing a lot, if you want to help, don't hesitate!

##### *NOTE:* In the ratio plugin when you break the cobblestone, something empty may come out by chance, don't worry, this is a luck plugin, and if you see something missing, please don't forget to report it.
